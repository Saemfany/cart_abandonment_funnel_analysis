# 🛒 Cart Abandonment Funnel Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes user behavior in an e-commerce checkout process to identify key drop-off points and optimize conversions. By leveraging data insights, we aim to reduce cart abandonment and improve the customer experience.  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset includes user interactions at different stages of the checkout funnel:  
- **Total Users**  
- **Add to Cart**  
- **Proceed to Checkout**  
- **Complete Purchase**  

Additional breakdowns include dropout rates by **device type** and **dropout reasons** to provide deeper insights.  

## 📌 Key Questions
1. What is the distribution of users across each stage of the funnel?  
2. Which device type has the highest abandonment rate?  
3. What are the main reasons users abandon the checkout process?  
4. Are there behavioral differences based on the device used?

## 🚀 Key Insights  
- High dropout occurs at the **Proceed to Checkout** stage.  
- **High shipping costs** are the top reason for abandonment.  
- **Mobile users** experience the most friction, leading to lost conversions.  

## 🔍 Analysis Approach  
1. **Funnel Analysis**: Examining conversion rates at each stage.  
2. **Device-Based Comparison**: Identifying behavioral differences.
